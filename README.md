Gaussian Lienar models on antarctic penguins  

Hi there! The main R file is "Final.R". Before running the code be sure 
that the stan files are in your working directory. You find them in the directory called
Stan.  

For refernce, the stan files are all models we used to test the data... at least all the model we kept working on (otherwise they would have been too many models lol)
Moreover, inside the R file, near the title of the models there is a "YES" or a "NO" meaning if the model has been taking into account in the report in model comparison.
The principal three models are "Separate2.stan", "Hierarchical1.stan" and "AllSeparate_nointer_nosexwidth.stan".
